    "bio" : "Software Engineer with an analytical and curious mind. My passions are demonstrated in my work experience: equity, storytelling, and problem-solving. As the owner of a database of 18,000 records, I created the data schemas, models, queries, documentation, and workflows. In the middle of optimization through automation, I realized I wanted to be the one to create the database. After years of organizing data for users, Iâ€™m looking to create web applications within a collaborative and joyful team.",
